![Alt text](screenshots/gameplay.png?raw=true "Gameplay")

Set in real-world scenarios, players take control of cartoonish citizens who freakout and fall out with each other. The players must then push their opponents out of the arena by shoving them or making use of items.

Gather some friends and **LET THE CHAOS BEGIN**!
