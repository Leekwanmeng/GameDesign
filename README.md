# Public Freakout
Public Freakout is a **casual multiplayer arena brawl party game** where players compete to be the last person standing in the arena.

Set in real-world scenarios, players take control of cartoonish citizens who freakout and fall out with each other. The players must then push their opponents out of the arena by shoving them or making use of items. As the game progresses, the battle arena will shrink, forcing players closer to each other to encourage combat, the last person standing wins.

While Public Freakout is a casual game, it also provides a depth of skillful play by rewarding precision and accuracy, ensuring that long-time players will still be engaged when they play this game.
